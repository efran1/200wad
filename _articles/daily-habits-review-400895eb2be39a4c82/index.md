I kinda get over the podcasts listening. Sure I do not say it's not good but sometimes all the people there are just too smart. It feels like everyone wants to find some new way of thinking and find special habits and routines but I think most of the time it's just good old hard work. You just cannot skip that part. 

Btw. My current list of habits doing daily:

*   Writing (here)
*   Reading(just a little bit)
*   Drawing + photoshop edit
*   Working on my side project (usually just more writing)
*   Logo design - random logo just to practice Adobe Illustrator
*   10 pull-ups, push-ups, plank, handstand + shadow boxing,
*   Writing down 10 ideas (it can be everything, from business ideas to some interesting quotes or motivation sentences.
*   Play guitar (it's about 30 minutes exercise, I should do more but I am lazy)
*   Duolingo - still learning Spanish (it's from English so I learn both languages)

Yeah, I guess that's it. Not much but still sometimes hard to do everything, haha.

The next week is gonna be finally some sports on the tv (of course without an audience) but I cannot wait. I love sport to watch or play so live without it was kinda hard in these corona times.
