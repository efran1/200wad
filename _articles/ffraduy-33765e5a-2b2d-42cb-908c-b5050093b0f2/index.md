Tomorrow I Am going to my cousin's wedding. A big part of my family will meet up. Its gonna be nice cuz in recent months we couldn't meet cuz of the all COVID craziness. It's a very last-minute celebration cuz since Monday we are gonna be again in an emergency state. COVID cases are going higher and higher but who cares right? It should be just for 30 days but our government just wants to save everyone so maybe we are gonna stay lockdown until the end of our days. WE just need to wear spacesuits and "enjoy" our life. I do not know what should I think about all of this. We got caught in a never-ending loop and politicians are just afraid to make hard decisions. I think its gonna be necessary very soon. No job, no money, depression. COVID is a piece of cake compared to this bright future. It's really hard to speak up. You know, it is not about keeping all this virus easy. We should be careful and keep the hygiene strict but we cannot stop the economy it will bring so many problems. The businessman and woman cannot lose hope otherwise we are screwed.
