I am already 5 days on my sugar break and to be honest it sucks:D. I do not feel bad in case of mood changes or low energy but I just have strong cravings.

Sure I still eat fruits but omg I would like to have some cake. I think I am gonna try this experiment for 2 weeks. I need to just get to regular work out and improve my eating habits.

It should be enough, If I am gonna work out and run properly there will be no harm to eat some sweets and that's my plan.

I am happy I realized this very soon. I will be more aware of my food and adjust it to my current state.Â 

All week I eat healthier. I struggle little with the portions. I eat a decent breakfast and kinda big lunch but almost no dinner. Just some fruits or nothing. It is manageable but I am very hungry every morning haha. I should probably make the portions smaller and eat more times a day.

This week is hard but hopefully, as I am gonna get used to it's gonna have a very positive effect.

I am sure that mainly the no sugar challenge will help a lot.

Stay with me. Efran.
