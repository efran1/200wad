I think I haven talked about this new habit of mine that much. But about 90 days ago I started to record daily reviews to my iPhone. It is similar to a written diary but spoken. I called it SelfCast but I know it's kinda stupid name but I keep sticking with it, haha.

I am not sure where this habit should be leading but I kinda like it. 

A few weeks back I added listening my previous day review before I actually record the new one.

I am just talking what interesting and not interesting happened to me that particular day, which thoughts going trough my mind and so on.

It's good for remembering the days, I can go back in weeks, months and see what I was thinking about. Can see how my goals changing if I keep chasing the goals I set while back. 

Just another checker to overview my life.

As I said it's one of my favorites habits. Probably I just like to listen to my beautiful voice but will see maybe it will help me to stay on track and evaluate my efforts.

I really like trying new habits will definitely add some more ... btw my running streak is already 19. :)
