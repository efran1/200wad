My MacBook upgrading is over for a while. Yesterday I moved everything to my second upgrade. The final result is not perfect  I made a mistake at the end and there is a little issue with the display. I hate it but what can I do, lesson learned. :)

Anyway, the Macbook pro is working and I am gonna use it. Time to move to other hobbies :).

I am definitely gonna go running this weekend. I like the feeling and it helping me start the day properly.

I also started to read _**The Crossroads of Should and Must: Find and Follow Your Passion**_ book by _**Elle Luna**_... I didn't pursue reading a lot recently so I am happy I can be back. It's a nice book but I guess the content is nothing new under the sun. Easy read. I like the design of the book, very cool illustrations.

Hopefully, it will not be just one book but I am gonna keep reading for a while. Again the biggest hassle on the scene _Which book should I read next?_ I need to just don't give up the struggle and actually pick something, haha. 

  

Enjoy your weekend.

Stay with me. Efran.
