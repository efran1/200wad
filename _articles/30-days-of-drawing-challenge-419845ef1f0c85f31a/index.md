A while ago I already mentioned this challenge. I wanted to learn how to draw and to improve my Adobe photoshop skills. I tried to do one piece of art every day for 30 days. 

As you can already know me, 30 days in a row is a piece of cake :). 

I finished this challenge already a month ago but until today I was lazy to write about it. I hope I am gonna be able to make also a video on my Youtube channel.

It was a simple challenge I just draw something and then made the coloring in Adobe Photoshop.

I think you can see some improvement throughout the days.

If you would like to see the result. You can go through the whole gallery on my personal blog (please don't laugh).

Here is the link:

It was fun. Unfortunately, since the end of the challenge, I wasn't able to continue to draw. The laziness won once again. I hope I am gonna be back in this hobby soon.

It would be such a shame to do not to pursue talent like this...

Do you think that 3 years old would draw better than me?:D
