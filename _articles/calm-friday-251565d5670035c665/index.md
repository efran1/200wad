I would be happier any other Friday but we having some trade show again. So I am gonna work on Sunday (hopefully the Saturday will still be free) better than nothing, haha.

Today I woke up at 6 AM, I had to, fortunately I survived this early time. Actually, it wasn't that hard. You just cannot go late to bed.

Omg the last few weeks (maybe longer) I cannot really focus on my daily writing. 

It's usually just daily summary and blabbing about nothing.

Also I wanna finish my daily writing as fast as possible, of course, it leads to really bad writing. Maybe some 200 days streak crisis. Hope it get's better after 300 :D.

But I got a little stuck in all direction, my side projects are on stand by, at daily job it's just a survive mode and so on.

I just really need a vacation to restart and reorganize and refresh.

If I get to myself better I can perform better and adjust my way to the right direction. 

I am still calm and taking it easy. No rush and no stress. :)

Ok let's enjoy at least the Friday night and my shortened weekend. 

Have a nice weekend.

Stay with me. Efran.
