In my mind there is this stupid feeling when I am always telling myself I have been, seen, discovered that particular thing first.

It always comes to my mind if someone traveled to the country I've already been or shared the song I 've already listened a year ago. It's not the finest attribute of me but I just cannot help myself. It's not that I would brag about it and commenting the pictures and saying hey I saw everything and you are lame but the feeling is inside me hehe.  It's usually connected if someone shares too many pics from one place or in general just talk a lot about the thing. 

But I know I should be more nice and wishing. It is bothering me I shouldn't even care haha it is so stupid cuz you never first. I mean I am never first either its just this feeling somewhere in my head that I am better.

I hope I am not alone with this :D. But its important I am not saying all these things out loud It's hidden just inside me.

I promise I am gonna stop thinking about it. :) Take care.

Stay with me. Efran.
