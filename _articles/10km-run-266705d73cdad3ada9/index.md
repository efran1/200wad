Yeah, the two weeks of running was finished with the longest run so far 10 km.

Actually I wasn't plan this at all. 

The story behind is simple. Here in Prague took place classic big city run. My father wanted to participate but he couldn't run cuz a small injury. So I took his place. I wouldn't take it if I wouldn't practice before.

It already happened once a few years back the same competition. I almost die cuz I took it without training. But at least I knew what I could expect today.

Its evening race / better to say a night race the official start was at 7:30 PM.

So many people participate it's crazy how many people running but yeah 10 km isn't that much you can just test your skills before longer run. Still pretty exhausting.

Anyway, I survived today with pretty good time. I run fast cuz I wanna have it done fast, haha. (If would be someone interested I had 10 km in 44:21 min).

I felt good almost all the race just last 2 kilometers was pretty hard. Still I could make it until the finish line.

The feeling after the race is the best. Exhausted but happy.

What is gonna be the next? Half marathon? will see :)

Enjoy the night.
