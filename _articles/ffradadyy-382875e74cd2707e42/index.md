I try to make a schedule every day. So far is the second day, haha and it's the same as the day before. A little bit of writing in the morning, playing guitar, reading, cooking lunch and so on. It is interesting that if I write it down into my calendar. (I use just the iOS Calendar app) I actually follow what is there. It is an invisible forcing hand that leads me through the day. If I do not schedule anything I just hanging around and waste so much time. I should just schedule everything. The past two days I was finishing around 4 PM after that I wasn't able to back on track. In two days I was able to finish another post for my niche project so it all makes sense. I also could move forward with the Company of one by Paul Jarvis. I really like the book it is an interesting one. It just could be without the modern "diversity, gender pay gap" lines in the text. I just do not understand why everyone feels like sending these moral messages even though it is complete nonsense. Anyway, it is a good motivator to start a company. So I definitely recommend. :)

  

Tomorrow I plan to go outside into the wasteland of Prague. Hopefully will survive, haha.
