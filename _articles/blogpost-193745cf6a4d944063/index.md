If you wouldn't know ... Tuesday is about a new blog post. I already wrote it and posted it. It's funny. 9 weeks ago I just said that I am gonna be back with the regular schedule and every Tuesday will upload a new post. Since then I never missed that. When I committed this I hadn't any plan what I should write about I just hoped I can find something and it is working.

Usually, even don't know the topic in advance just sit down in front of the computer and write. It's not probably the best way and I should plan in advance. The posts would get definitely better. Hopefully, I will get there. (sometimes I have the topic in advance, writing 10 ideas a day, sometimes brings blog topics ideas :))

The posts also aren't just to fill the space so I could mark my Tuesday duty but all of them are around 1000 words. Which is pretty good ... Yeah, I am becoming a writing machine hehe. 

Okay okay, it is still just for 9 weeks but let's aim next 9 weeks and see if I can still continue with this Tuesday writing craziness.
