I kinda you use my blog for experimenting and everything is possible there. I am not keeping the same topic across all the posts. Sometimes it's traveling sometimes working sometimes ordinary life. It's not probably idle but since it is my blog I can do whatever I want hehe.

For today's blog post I did just longer review of Late bloomers book by Rich Karlgaard. I already write a short review here but cuz I really liked that book I feel I can write the whole blog post. 

You can check it here: [Late bloomers](https://www.worktravelenjoy.com/review-late-bloomers-the-power-of-patience-in-a-world-obsessed-with-early-achievement/)

I already finished the Steal Like an Artist by Austin Kleon. Short book but nice thoughts inside.

Will see which book I am gonna pick up next. Thinking about Deep Work by Cal Newport.

Finally getting into the reading zone. Last year was weak but this year I have already finished 7 books. It's not anything special but better than nothing hehe.

Would like to read at least 15 books this year. It should be a bare minimum. Funny I read just in English maybe I should read something in my mother tongue as well.

Ok, take care. Seeya tomorrow.
