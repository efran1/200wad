I was able to send out the sixth issue of my newsletter yesterday. It was first without a standalone interview but instead, I tried to summarize my failed e-commerce project. 

The numbers are pretty similar to previous issues so I guess it wasn't a wrong step. 

I keep mixing the form of the content. I use the [explodingtopics.com](https://explodingtopics.com/) to add some interesting hot trends (to be honest I just copy their newsletter, haha). I think it's a successful part of my newsletter so as my "book tips" section.

I am subscribed to different kinds of newsletters so I just try to pick the best parts and enlist them into my newsletter. 

I wanna also make my newsletter a little bit artsier so I added up a little bit of my photoshop art as a hero image. It looks much better now.  Why do not show my talent, right? :D.  I am gonna get probably tons of new subscribers cuz of that.  It's about time.  

Ok, I am just joking. No one cares about my art so far. buut it can happen. :)

  

Let's go boxing and have a good feeling before the weekend.

Stay with me. Efran
