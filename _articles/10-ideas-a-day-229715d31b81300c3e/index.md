Recently @seunoyebode and @jasonleow wrote about writing ideas daily again.

Since the 22nd of January 2019, I am keeping this habit inspired by James Altucher. I usually use just a paper notebook and weekly write it down to [my Coda doc](https://www.worktravelenjoy.com/no-coding-in-coda-first-little-project-ideaskeeper/).

It's already 178 days, so about 1780 ideas written down since then.  

It's not just about business ideas, it can be just everything stupid what comes to my mind hehe (life thoughts, book quotes, ideas for other habits, blog posts topic tips, etc.). Sometimes it's working just like a journal. It's my favorite habit. I am really enjoying it.

I would say it's working the most for the blog posts or video topics ideas (if I am talking about myself). I came up with some website projects ideas as well but executed just one which I am currently working on. I am not sure how could I measure the purpose of this habit but 1 from 1780 probably is not much hehe.

Anyway, as I said I really like to doing it so I am not planning to stop with this habit.

Maybe better to pick just a few categories to focus on, to get the best results.

I guess I wrote already some review of this habit, this is just another update :)

Stay with me. Efran.
