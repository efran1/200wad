Sometimes it is time. I decided to go all-in with my new local newsletter. Just work on it as much as I can. I send a lot of emails, bothering people, bothering my friends and family. It's kinda fun :D.

I do enjoy it. I have a clear goal, now I just need to get there, step by step.Â 

I could divide my work now into 2 parts. The first one is just to talk about my project everywhere I can, contacting my friends who could be interested to subscribe. Simple direct marketing. I am not very strong about this. I have never talked before about my projects with anyone and always was kinda embarrassed but this time I need to do a different approach. No more hiding and do proper marketing.

The second part is to get some content. Obviously, I need some content for my newsletter. I started contacting local web entrepreneurs as well as global ones. I do not have any strong network so it is usually just a good old cold email. I need to just keep it going and keep it pushing. Sure, not all of them answer but as I tried with the authors and bloggers, some of them will and that's enough for now. I need to start somewhere. :)

Wish me luck
