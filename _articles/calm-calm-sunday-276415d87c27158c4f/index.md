After the exhausting prolonged work week came a pretty calm Sunday.

Actually I had a very productive morning. I tidied my room. Threw away many things. Maybe more than I should but I am not gonna look back, haha. 

After that I did go running I planned to run a little longer than usual but in the end, it was 10 km and about 50 minutes of running. So I exceeded my expectation.

I felt good during the running, no thoughts about giving up but I was still pretty exhausted after so the rest of the day was more chilled. After a long time, I took even a nap during the day. 

Just one exception I needed to babysit my niece and nephew for a while but they are nice so it wasn't that hard.

In the evening I stayed just in front of the television. My favorite soccer team played against the biggest rival. We won so I couldn't imagine a better ending of the day.

I am gonna go to bed soon. I never wanna be in bed later than 11 PM it is one of the key success to do not struggle with the early wake-up time.

Goodnight.
