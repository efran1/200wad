I am over chilled. 

Let's forget about this weekend in case of productivity.

Actually, I wanna do a little challenge. I try to avoid sweets. Believe me it's super hard for me. 

I love sweets and all kind of snacks. I almost cannot imagine do not eat something sweet after every meal.

I do not wanna do the hardcore mode which would be avoiding all the sugar cuz I think it's impossible .. sugar is everywhere .. I wanna just avoid the clear cases. No more adding sugar into the coffee (maybe no more coffee cuz I don't like coffee without sugar, haha), no more sweets, no more snacks. 

I could make it this weekend. Will see if I am gonna be able to keep it a little longer. Keep my level of energy in the limit. 

In the beginning I am gonna be probably lazier than usual but I hope it will get to the normal in time.

That's why I wanna try this challenge just make my energy level more stable. Usually I have super productive days followed by super lazy days. I just wanna stay somewhere in the middle everyday. Will see.

Stay with me. Efran.
