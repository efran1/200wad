Yeah, so I keep waiting. My friend's baby hasn't arrived yet but it should be very soon. I am more nervous than him haha. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is the final date. I will visit him for sure and have some drinks.

Anyway, after a very successful soccer night yesterday, I didn't do much. Yeah, great Friday. The day is not over yet so hopefully, I can find some productivity later on.

From time to time I comment on something on Twitter. I do not do it much but sometimes I cannot hesitate. If I see something I do not agree with I have to react. Twitter is full of moral and "always right" people and I cannot stand it. Fast smart google people just popping up everywhere you just cannot see any individual opinion.Â 

I know it's better to stay away cuz the neverending wars are just pointless but I needed to get it out.

Steam out. If you are overwhelmed it is good therapy. I am not very strong with the wording I never dive deeper into these fights but if you are too silent no one can hear you ...

Stay sane. Efran
