The big league achieved. 

Just a few days before the end. I am glad for this mark. I was about to give up on 600 mark but 700 sounds better. 

I am gonna stay here until the very end. After that I am gonna move to the new platform (which one will be the one? @brandonwilson) but I am sure I will not stick to my streak anymore. I enjoyed this ride and learned a lot but I will try to focus on better content more than the quantity, hehe. :) Maybe also heal a little from this streak addiction! 

Thank you Brandon for keeping me motivated. You are definitely the one who keeps this community together. I am happy I could be part of your [#teamstreak](#teamstreak) and stay with you until the end.

The another challenge will be as I mentioned in previous post to try some writing in my native language. Just keep pushing and improving. To be a better writer in general. It's still long way to go :)...

What can I say. Writing is great. Keep writing guys it's not a wasted time even if it would be just for clearing your mind.

Stay with me. Efran
