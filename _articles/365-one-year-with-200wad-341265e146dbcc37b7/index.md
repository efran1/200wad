Fist of all Thank you @basilesamel

What a year, right?! 

A year ago, I was wandering around the Product Hunt and then **200 Words a day** appeared. I already had my personal blog so the writing wasn't a stranger to me.

I was like whatever and wrote my first post - [New start](https://200wordsaday.com/words/new-start-32485c349244d1ef4) then another one and another one ... 364 posts later and I am still here. 

To be honest I didn't come here to be a better writer or write some fiction. It's too far from my actual skills (as you can see if you have ever read some of my posts, haha). 

I wanted just to keep going with English do not forget everything after my comeback home. That's why you can see a lot of personal posts and daily bluff.

I AM SORRY :D.

Because of 200WaD, I didn't give up on my personal blog **Worktravelenjoy.com** I wrote 49 posts this year (new record).

I started a new project **Nocodemag.com** even though I didn't continue for a long time it was a good experience. If you find a trend and write good content around it can be successful. My **Coda vs Notion article** since upload has brought over 1000 visitors even though I didn't touch it for months. 

I was experiencing with Youtube and make **OrganizeLife channel** (19 new videos, 54 subscribers, 1900 views) it's super small but it was such a big step out of my comfort zone and I plan to experience more.

I tried a different kind of personal challenges. Running, no coffee, no sugar, playing guitar, meditation ...

... and all of that wouldn't happen without this amazing community and many interesting people around here. Thank you, guys :) 

@brandonwilson @jasonleow @brianball @knight @keni @lucjah, @5plus6 @jacklyons, @gabrielgreco @danielmiller @hum @philh @seunoyebode @abrahamKim @juliasaxena @phaidenbauer @craigpetterson @keenencharles

and many more. :) I am happy I can be part of the community.

  

First, I used at the end of every post **Stay tuned**, hoped for something better come .. it didn't happen. So I changed it to **Stay with me**, hoped you do not give up on me ...

  

Please don't :)

\--------

Stay tuned and stay with me. I do not plan to stop wandering around. 

Efran. :)
