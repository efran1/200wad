So another day in COVID paradise. People just losing their minds. We hear just the "end of the world" predictions from media and it's just all going to end. 

My opinion is still the same. The situation is not easy but we just need to keep it calm. Don't scare people and just do the job. Focus on the most affected groups, protect them, and manage the hospitals according to the current situation. Don't overkill the free space just add up by the time in a state of emergency. Medics do know what they are doing so we should just trust them a little bit.

I am against all this crap. The virus is here and we just need to live with that. Try to protect yourself but do not stop the economy and keep businesses, schools, and basic life going. 

COVID sucks, people will die but how about the life of 95% of people. What about anxieties that are caused by all those restrictions and staying home narrative. If we survive COVID but die for depression it's a good thing or what? What is the bigger picture? I do not feel anyone really keeps that in the mind. There is just a narrow focus.
