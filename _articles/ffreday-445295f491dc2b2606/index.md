I am almost there. One last day before the 600, can I make it there or not? We will see that tomorrow! :)

I didn't do anything else except designing today. I uploaded about 4 new designs. I focused on my travel photos. I have so many pics from Toronto, Mexico, Island, Bali, and more so I am gonna try to make some designs out of it. 

It's not that hard. I just adjust the photo a little bit and upload it. 

I very hooked so far. Photoshopping and Illustrating all day long. I guess it's fine until I am having fun why not to try it. It's not just about Redbubble but I do improve my Photohospon skills and that's also important. It's not just wasted time, haha.

Sure if there would be some sales the motivation would be much higher but I guess it's not gonna happen anytime soon.

  

Let's get to see some culture. I am going with my sister to the theater. I haven't been quite a while there so it's an interesting Friday night. Otherwise, I would go to a boxing lesson but hey, culture is important as well. 

Enjoy your weekend.

Stay with me. Efran.
