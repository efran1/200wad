That is a long election in America. The winner is clear right now but the close call almost everywhere will lead to a prolonged final decision. I guess no wonder. Hopefully, if they will recount the close states and show the numbers everything will get calm. But yeah, many weeks of insecurity ahead of the USA.

It's a very bad situation. The country is split and there is no winner. 

Actually, I don't mind Biden that much but he is just past his prime. If he would be in lead it could be all right but the far-left is just behind his back. Harris just waits for her chance and it's not a good sign. It's not the way to go. 

Beginning of crisis. COVID, economy, and all that shit. It could be a very hard hit. 

The world is watching hope this madness will end soon.

God bless.

OK, let's leave the problems of America to America :D and focus on my problems. Those are the only problems I should care about. :D. Make my life better and just move forward. I got stuck. Time to start flying again and live :).

Stay sane. Efran
