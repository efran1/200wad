I have plans for the night. So I need to check all my daily duties very soon.

I hate Duolingo it happened maybe the third time already but they didn't count my daily exercises and I lost my streak freeze, yeah, fortunately, this feature saved me my actual streak but still I am not happy about it.Â 

It can happen again and right now I do not have enough app currency to purchase it.

Anyway, I think they making it in purpose to unpaying users. They just try to force them to spend some money on the app.

Yeah, no wonder and I can understand buuut it seems a little bit unfair to me.

You cannot see it's happening there is no sigh of missing exercises I have even in the daily stats marked as finished. It's just one big hassle. (my life is so hard, why always me :D)

so yeah, for now, is my Spanish streak saved but it's gonna be a tough fight with the app creators :D.

I am not gonna give up. I have 269 days streak and I would like to finish the perfect year haha. Will see.

Stay with me. Efran.
