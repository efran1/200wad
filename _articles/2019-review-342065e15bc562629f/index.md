A few years back I started to write my year review.

Always at the begging of the new year, I looked back to the previous year and try to see how did it go.  What was a success and what didn't go that well?

In the end, I compare my goals with reality and set some goals for the next year.

It's just another tool that helps you to evaluate your life and see if you wandering on the right path.

I do not check what I wrote into the previous review during the year so it's also interesting to see which goals I planned to achieve (my memory is bad haha).

Anyway, this is wasn't that bad in case of goals but if I am talking about health and overall condition I didn't feel very well.  I hope for better in 2020.

If you would like to read the whole review. You can check my post on my personal blog here (it's not a final version I need to update it a little bit in following days):
