After I passed yesterday running I was able to go today. Actually, I woke up at 6:30 and by 7:00 I was already back home. It is just a short run. This week I went twice. Hopefully, I will not be lazy and I am gonna keep it going.

So at 7:00, I started my day. I was thinking about it and I am not sure if it's good or I am just getting crazy. Why so early? I don't need to do it, I could go at 10:00. The only boss who looking at me is me. Nevermind, I will be checking on myself, keep you informed if it's craziness or what the hell is going on, haha.

Anyway, the Czech people are still so good. One of our best technical universities developed a prototype of a ventilator (which is important for fight with the coronavirus in the serious cases of the sickness) and they needed to back it up to make hundreds of them. In a one day, they collected over 400 000USD backed up just by the public. They can start the production now and until the end of April should be most of them done, that's truly amazing.
