Do you like your free time or do you like keeping yourself busy all day?

I am a pretty comfortable person. I would always prefer free time instead of neverending busyness. buuuut ...

For example, my busiest days are when I go boxing. I am at work from 9 until 18:30 and my boxing lesson is from 19:00 until 20:30 .. I arrive home after 21:00. I never wanna be in bed later than 22:30 ... so there are 90 minutes for eating, shower, reading... I would say it's not much and all day is gone if I compare it to my normal day. I work until 17:00 so usually I am around 18:00 back home. Still, there is not much power to do something productive and usually, I waste my time with youtube videos. 

.. so If I get my free time I should be happy, right? but the reality is a little different. The feeling after the boxing lesson (it can be any work out) is just awesome. I am exhausted, beaten up but happy and all day kinda make sense. 

Anyway, what I am trying to say:

**Don't be lazy** .. I am talking to myself hehe. :)). I should remember this when I am lazy to do some workout :)
