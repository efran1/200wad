Back in the game. I simply love it. The writing under pressure is my cup of tea.

Let's do it. 

As I mentioned in the previous post I am thinking to start a new project. It's gonna be around no-code movement and simply focused just on content. Cuz I cannot think off any app and still I think it's not the best way to put your strength into coding (if you are not a coder) ...  If you love to code, sure you can code but just force something cuz "it's good to know" I would say it's not the best idea.

Create a content-based website feels like the right thing to do for me. Past a few years, I write a lot on my blog or in here. So that would be one part of the project and the other part would be video content. Only things I can do somehow or I don't mind to learn.

Yeah so the concepts are clear, the only thing is to start with something. Probably the hardest part. I need to write down some schedule and some principles for the direction I would like to go.

I have it in my mind but put it into a paper form or online form would be better... I wanna see it bright and clear.

Ok, that's a little introduction of my future (possible) project. Will keep you informed if I will decide to kick it off.

Stay with me. Efran.
