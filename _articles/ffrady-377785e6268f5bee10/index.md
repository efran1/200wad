its gonna be probably chilling weekend at home as usual. I need to finish a second post for my new project (yeah, I was pushing much this week) and that's it.

Its gonna be a big goal so I do not need to stress with some other tasks. Just write a little bit more, edit and public. 

The first post goes much easier. This one is a little harder I do not have personal experience so I am just researching the internet. and it gets pretty boring.

Unfortunately, this post is much more important. The search volume is bigger and if its gonna be written properly it can get a lot of people to my website.

So I must get through the struggles and write a nice piece. 

I think I got some strength back so hopefully, I will write more and more. 

This is my final month of working full time.

 Since April its gonna be different. Three days hassling on my side projects and two days at work. It's gonna be interesting I do not have any side incomes yet. So from zero to hero or for zero to zero. You never know :)
