Another day another story

I use the public transport to write my 200 words, time used well.

During the morning running i felt pretty bad, i just wanted to get it done. What is funny i run the fastest. I should reevaluate my feelings haha.

I struggle with the dinners. I feel its really important to have some good meal, but i cannot force myself to cook. 

Cuz usually I'm tired and wanna eat fast. Unfortunately there is noo healthy fast food around my place. 

Make a meal plan would help of course .. do groceries and have everything prepared day by day to make the cooking easier would do the job ..

Need to figure it out on sunday probably .. if you get into working week unprepared its hard to get on the right path (yeah, it works for all aspects of life :)

Yeah it is just morning and I am thinking what I am gonna have for dinner what a hassle :)))

I am a little afraid that today is gonna win McDonalds or something like that. Wanna watch Champions league and i dont have much time after work. Will see if i will change my mind until the night :)

Lets get to work.

Stay with me. Efran
