It's Friday, time to take it easy. I read all day and just hang around. I wasn't able to do something productive today (except morning running).

I even took an evening nap it hasn't happened to me for a long time and it was a bad idea I feel so weird, right now. Nevermore :D.

Still reading Â _So good they can't ignore_ by Cal Newport you and still amazing. The right book at the right time. I am gonna change my thinking a lot.

Yesterday I made a little life recap. I took it in depth, I tried to remember my school years since elementary school until university graduation. It wasn't year by year but more like every particular phase I even checked my qualification reports.

I was a very mediocre student I must say. Anyway, I didn't find anything special, haha, still it was interesting.

The worst thing about my school years were actually the schools I choose. The second grade in elementary school, my high school even my university was a big misstep. I just always picked the wrong major. Totally out of my interest.

Better do not cry and improve it now! :)
