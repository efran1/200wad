I have been sending already 11th issue of my newsletter yesterday. The numbers slowly decreasing. No wonder cuz my newsletter sucks. I just cannot force myself to write good content. Anyway, the subscribers staying with me so far and I cannot disappoint them. I must bring back some interesting content.

Better do not think about that now.

I have some design projects (thank you Brandon :D). I tried to come up with some ideas but so far anything good. I will try harder!:). Definitely not giving up. Â Hopefully, I am gonna be productive on the weekend. I do have one more design to make for my friend so I am gonna be jumping between these two projects. It must be done on Monday :). I like to make it, finally some creative work so I believe in the bright ending.

Otherwise, I do not have any big plans for the weekend. Just figure out my life :D. I guess I am gonna be done in a minute, haha.

It's beautiful weather outside I am gonna go to have some beers with my friends. Time to socialize a little bit more and have some fun.

Enjoy your weekend.

Stay with me. Efran
