... I haven't earned the one dollar yet .. so the challenge continues hehe. 

First, I need to find ways how could I earn it. In the online world, there is a lot of ways how to earn something online. Let's see my possible options.

*   I could do some WordPress gigs - install, update, make slight changes. It could probably work but I am not sure if I would enjoy it.
*   I could do some easy Graphic design gigs in Canva - I already helped a few times to my friends. I would enjoy this more, but I am not so skilled. 
*   My affiliate site could earn something - Probably the most comfortable way how to earn something but my old site is stupid and if it would earn something I guess it will happen during the Christmas time and I am not that patient. So I should build a better website or find another way.
*   I could do some copywriting - I have never tried it .. only for my own projects, but why not right? if I keep writing hehe. 

  

There are definitely more options I was just thinking out loud about my option and I am kinda bored.  hehe .. Will see if I can make one dollar. Will keep you informed. :)

Stay with me. Efran.
