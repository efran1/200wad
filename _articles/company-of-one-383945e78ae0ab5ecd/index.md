Yesterday I finished the Company of one by Paul Jarvis. Its been my fourth book since the beginning of 2020. So I am -2 two books according to my schedule. I hope I am gonna be back on track soon.

Anyway, it's a decent book. I like the idea behind it very much. You don't need to grow exponentially to have a successful business. Focus on growth is not the only way how to succeed. 

Paul has nice ideas and describing his way and shows some other examples. It is pretty cool and it matches with my point of view. If ever I would like to go the same way. Focus on my clients or customers and provide great support. Build the relationship and improving the processes. It's a pretty suitable way to go.

The content is great. I guess it could be a little shorter sometimes there is so much sauce and blabbing around. He also brings some topics into the text which are completely unrelated and just pissing me off. 

Anyway, I definitely recommend. It gives you a needed push to try something new. I would like to finish my first e-book ever. I got the motivation cuz of the Company of one. So read it :)
