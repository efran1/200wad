My friend came to visit me for 2 days. We got one more day off cuz of the national holidays so we could explore the city together. My hometown is nice but so many tourists everywhere. It's getting crazier and crazier you just bumping into the people on every corner. It is hard to keep calm hehe. Anyway, it's nice to see the town from time to time and remember all the beautiful sights.... but just time to time hehe...

My friend is gonna leave soon I will spend the rest of the day just at home. Need to gain some strength back after the "few" beers yesterday:)

I am writing this post from Starbucks. You can hate Starbucks but I think it's the best place where you can in the corner with your laptop. I just don't feel comfortable in small coffee shops. The atmosphere could be better but I feel I take place to other customers. Sure in Starbucks it is the same but I just don't care hehe. I feel more anonymous.

When I worked in a small coffee shop in Toronto we just hate chilling students sipping just one coffee all day. It's your customer but still, the chilling time should be limited.

Ok no more hating my second hour in Starbucks just starting and the coffee is getting cold. I am such a hypocrite ?
