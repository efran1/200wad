Almost forget to write today hehe. Anyway, I tried to get the things moving a little on Saturday. Even though the weather is so hot and exhausting. Can't wait for the rain to refresh the air. Otherwise, I am gonna die.

 In the morning I started to fill my 10 ideas a day to my Coda doc from a whole week. I am not writing the ideas every day into the doc cuz I am lazy and actually it's kinda good to re-read the all ideas after the week and think about them one more time. 

Today I also started to write in advance a new post for my blog. First-time in history hehe, usually I write it all on Tuesday (the scheduled day for a new post). The topic is gonna be about WordPress plugins. Need to also think of the topic for tomorrow's youtube video. That will be harder. Thinking to change the day for videos, not sure if Sunday is the best for posting a new one, I mean no one is really checking youtube on Sunday hehe. Maybe just make it on Sunday and post it some other day. Will see.

Have a nice weekend.

Stay with me. Efran.
