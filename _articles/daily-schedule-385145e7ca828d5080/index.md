At the beginning of my home officiant, I was super lazy. I couldn't force myself to do anything.  It changed a little 5 days ago. I started to use the Mac OS Calendar and simply scheduling all my day. The timing is not that strict, I can just see what should I do and helping me not to forget. It works like charm. I am able to manage all my daily habits and of course, work on my side projects (mostly writing). 

Actually, today was the first day I took it a little bit easier, I was planning to go running in the morning, but I decided to sleep instead, haha. Hopefully, I will go tomorrow. I have to do something otherwise I am gonna get crazy, I have been grocery shopping last two days, just to get out of the house. Not so many people outside, nice and calm. 

Anyway, I recommend you do the same. Just plan your day ahead and follow the schedule. I do not say I am super productive right now, but I always do at least the bare minimum. So I do not feel bad. 

My cowriters writing is scheduled too, so here I am haha. :)

Stay safe. Efran.
