Almost exactly 2 months ago (17th of May) I renewed my old affiliate project (website with t-shirts designs) and yesterday I got first commission (it's not approved yet).

Even if it wouldn't be approved I think it's a good sign. The traffic is low I am just adding one new post per week.

I think it should make decent money during the Christmas time. 

It sucks but the money are pretty good motivational booster. Maybe I will start work more on that project haha .. or maybe not ... 

Anyway, it's pretty good feeling. Just a few more steps and I am gonna be independent haha .. I set some future goal still long way to reach it :)..

 ... but this site was already making money and I got bored after a while .. hopefully this time will keep it going longer ... I mean this is only thing so far which could make me some money so why to stop it right ... 

I am not doing any paid promotion, so it's just from organic traffic. I try look at trends and post designs according to that. The copy is pretty short. I am lazy to think of something deep and long .. Easy money haha.

Stay with me. Efran.
