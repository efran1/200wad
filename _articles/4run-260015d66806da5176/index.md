Okay today is gonna be a little nervous post again cuz my favorite soccer team playing super important game. I can't wait. Hopefully it's gonna be with the successful ending.

Anyway, the running streak keep going. I hold my short track but thinking to run longer tomorrow .. just a little bit. I feel all right but still my feet are kinda heavy .. not yet pure pleasure of carefree running.

Actually, I do not fight with the waking up that much so far. What a surprise. It's pretty easy to get out of the bed.Â 

Just grab my running clothes and go. It's important to do not think about it that much. Not wait for long to leave the home ... and as I am already on the street I just have to run, haha.

I do not even do any stretching .. It's not the smartest thing but for now I just need to create some habit when I will be confident enough about my running go-to I can make some additional steps.

  

OK, that's enough for today I am so nervous about the soccer game.

Take care and enjoy your night.:)

Stay with me. Efran.
