its Tuesday so the day for the scheduled post to my blog. It's not really scheduled cuz I usually write the post on Tuesday haha. it's just the day I should write something (I have never missed already for 6 weeks hooray). 

If for nothing the 200WaD can work as some note pad. I can collect some ideas during the week and post it here. The final post on my blog can add just a little more sauce into it. 

The last two posts on my blog were like that and I am gonna use this approach more. It's simply logical. The thoughts during the week are similar. 

Have to say that I don't cheat the other way around I don't transform my blog posts into a few 200WaD posts haha ... but maybe if would some writing crisis appear and I am gonna do it.:)) but so far so good.

Sure you can promote content from your blog here ... post on 200WaD just some summary and motivate the visitors to come to your blog. Many people doing it and it's logical too.

... there is still a fight between sharing your content on your blog or use another platform ... I would have a problem with Medium (I have never posted there). I think there should be always a goal to have your own blog ... sure I can understand the easiness starting a blog there ... 

What do you think?
