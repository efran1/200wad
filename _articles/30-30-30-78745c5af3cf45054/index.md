What a beautiful anniversary with the 200WaD.  :)

So far **7610** words. I guess it's about a length of some children's book for now haha.  

30 days gone, to be honest, it's not getting any easier to write something day by day.  Still struggling to reach the magic 200 words count and the posting time it's closer and closer to midnight. What is important I am still alive and my streak keeps going (I know I know it's not just about the streak, but watch your back [@philh](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/philh), [@lucjah](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/lucjah), [@hiro](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/hiro), [@gabrielgreco](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/philh), [@itsabhinaya](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/itsabhinaya), [@keni](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/keni) I am waiting for your mistake to pass you on the fellowship board haha). 

Why I am still here?

I got tips for books, I discovered new blogs to follow, I got inspired by other people habits and trying to put them into my schedule. I can read about people thoughts from all over the world (Guys, why are we all fighting with the same struggles? haha).

I like the Makers movement even though I have never heard about it before I had joined the 200WaD. I like it but in the slowest pace haha.

... and many more...

It's time to celebrate I am gonna get a beer and hoped for the bright future of this awesome relationship.

Stay with 200WaD and stay with me. Efran
