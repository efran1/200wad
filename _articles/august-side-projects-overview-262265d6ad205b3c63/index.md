Hello,

The August is over. Time to write down some review about my side projects. 

Already the forth monthly review (you can check all on my personal blog).

Anyway, August was super lazy on my side. I kinda lost the track and couldn't push myself to do something meaningful. Despite of that I could keep the schedule.

My personal blog got stuck. There is no improvement in case of numbers of readers, subscribers and all the other metrics. It kinda sucks but I am not giving up. I like to write so there is no question about closing it down.

Nocodemag continues even though I lost the interest pretty fast. The post "Where to get some inspiration" got pretty good traction on Twitter but since then I wasn't able to write anything good. Hopefully the passion get back to me soon.:)

OrganizedLife channel is now connected to Nocodemag posts. I keep posting video a week but if there is no good post on Nocodemag there cannot be a good video on the channel. I need to be better. Still the numbers somehow are growing. I have already 29 subscribers :)

Affiliate site makes me happy. I do not spend much time on it. Just post a week written in a few minutes. No promotion just organic visitors and I got 4 commissions in August. It's actually making money which is a nice surprise.

If you would like to see the whole post with more numbers you can check it here:

I did go running today so I finished the whole week. In total I run around 20 Km (7 runs) it's not that much but for the beginning not that bad. I plan to keep going. :) 

Today also finishing the third week without coffee and without sweets (I couldn't avoid all the sugar). I feel all right but do not see a really big difference :D. Also keep going.

\-------------------

Stay with me. Efran.
