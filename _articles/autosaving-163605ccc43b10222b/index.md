I was just writing some super deep post for today. I needed just finish a few more words but then it suddenly happened. I deleted all my post. If this happens you are screwed (at least I think so or am I wrong?) cuz the post is automatically autosaved so there is no way back and you must just start all over again. Am I alone who experienced such a misfortune? I hope not :D.Â 

It happened to me already but just with a part of the post, not the whole one. This time was the post pretty bad so I don't mind but if I would write someday something good I guess I would be a little mad hehe.

How are you fighting against it?

Anyway, Its the worst to keep writing for the night ... so much pressure hehe. I wish I make it every morning but so far I cannot set up my morning routine at all (just wake up and wasting time hehe)

I take this post as last minute cuz I know I wouldn't get to it later cuz I have some plans for tonight so I must finish it now otherwise it would be streaksend.

Ok have a nice weekend and take care. :)

Stay with me. Efran.
