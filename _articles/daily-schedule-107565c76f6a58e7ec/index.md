Yesterday I almost fall asleep when I was writing my post. Sure I would like to do better today but not sure if I can make it happen haha.

Anyway, how are you guys today?

I just read @rasmusrygh post with the topic "I need more hours in the day". 

His daily schedule is pretty impressive. I mean the working hours are in normal but the rest of the day is super productive compared to mine for example. 

I am even shy to show you my daily schedule but whatever right. :))

So I always set up my alarm to 6:30 AM, buuut I don't need to wake up that early I just like the feeling when I can snooze the alarm for one more hour to 7:30 AM haha. I need to leave for work at 8:20 AM ... after wake up a just eat some breakfast, checking my phone and so I don't have any morning routine :/.

On my way to work, I just do my Duolingo exercises otherwise I would forget.

My work is from 9 to 5 PM, if I go to boxing I stay there till 6:30 PM ... the boxing lesson is from 7 until 8:30 PM.

I am at home usually around 9 PM  and I am super exhausted. I just write my 200 words, take a shower, eat some late food, play guitar for a while and read. 

I go to bed at around 11 PM ... It sounds pretty boring, right? Yeah, I could definitely make some improvements hehe.

Stay with me. Efran.
