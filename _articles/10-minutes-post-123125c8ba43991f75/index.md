Ok, today I have even less time than yesterday. I am gonna hang out with my friends and grab some beers.

By the way, It is time to celebrate my team won a big game yesterday.  The pure happiness I was jumping all over my apartment and screaming like a crazy. I guess the other tenants couldn't enjoy that like me haha.  Wow, it was really the best moment in a while.

Anyway, I really need to go and I really don't want to break my streak. 

@lucjah made a point recently. If we should focus to keep the streak alive or keep the quality content.  

For me it is easy I have never had a quality content so the streak is everything I got haha. The sad is that the streak is probably the only thing which keeps me to come back here every day. I hope it is just a bad period of time and I am gonna be more active and engaged to 200WaD community but yeah, it is what it is. I am worried if I would lose my streak I would lose my motivation totally but will see.

Enjoy your weekend. Stay positive and be happy.

Stay with me. Efran.
