I will try to push a little bit of the Czech political scene and make some t-shirts designs about current events. I will just put up some controversial designs and see if there is gonna be some buzz around. I will make some preorders forms and if it's gonna be enough preorders I would create the t-shirt.Â 

As I mentioned the topics are gonna be super on the edge but I am not very worried about it. I like these debates. I can handle the hate. I would like to troll the scene a little bit. Trigger the activist and just mess around with them. I just need to bring the designs in front of their eyes. It's a local project.

Since I already try to make some t-shirts designs. This is just part of my progression. I do not spend much time on it. I have an idea, make a design, and upload it on my website. I will move forward with this experiment just if I get some traction. Even if I would get some preorders I am gonna need the money first after I would get paid I would pay my supplier. I don't wanna do anything without actual interest.

Enjoy your weekend.
