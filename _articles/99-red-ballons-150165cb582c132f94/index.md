The day before I am gonna get into the big guys club. I cannot wait but let's celebrate tomorrow. So today I am gonna just prepare for the big day.

And I just remembered this classic by Nena, don't google it cuz you would sing that song all day. haha. Even though I like the German version more.

I feel already overwritten today cuz I already met today's quota with my blog post so I can a cheat a little with the lyrics below. 

> 99 dreams I have had  
> In every one a red balloon  
> It's all over and I'm standin' pretty  
> In this dust that was a city  
> If I could find a souvenir  
> Just to prove the world was here...  
> And here is, a red balloon  
> I think of you and let it go

I am gonna sing it all day haha...   

  

Anyway. I am happy I didn't break my streak so far, I am gonna write down some bigger summary tomorrow if I will show up here. You never know what is gonna happen but I plan to come back ... oooor?. Let's get surprised.:)) OK, OK no more blabbing around .. Take care .. see you tomorrow.

Stay with me. Efran.
