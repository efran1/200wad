I needed to start doing some sports cuz almost about a year I didn't work out at all. I could already feel the consequences. My productivity was getting low and in general, I wasn't happy about myself.

As you know (I already mentioned it in some of my previous posts) I have started visiting boxing lesson. The fighting sport wasn't really new for me I have been already visiting Thai boxing a few years ago. I stopped cuz I didn't enjoy it anymore. Anyway, I didn't turn my back forever. 

The boxing is a little bit different and so far it's pretty good and I try to go at least 2 times per week (I couldn't manage it just once cuz of my sickness otherwise keep this habit grow).

One part of every lesson is sparing. I would say it's the biggest fun, on the other hand, the most dangerous part as well. Yeah, receiving punches with my head it's probably not the healthiest thing ever but at least it can wake me up haha.

Anyway, even though I use a head guard on today's lesson I got a big black eye. I can feel it is gonna get even bigger and will play with many colors, fortunately, it doesn't hurt. I am not mad about it cuz it's just a part of the game.

Haha, but tomorrow I am gonna look good at work, hopefully, the clients will understand.:)
