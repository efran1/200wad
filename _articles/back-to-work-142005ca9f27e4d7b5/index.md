I still don't feel 100% but probably tomorrow will go back to work even though I didn't finish my antibiotics (still 2 days left). My boss would get mad if I wouldn't show up. 

Anyway, it's pretty lazy Sunday as I am getting better just a little cough staying with me. I can do a little bit of this and a little bit of that. 

Today I was checking the Makers no-code festival projects mostly based on Coda app. It is interesting to see other peoples ideas and how they executed it. It's funny to see how similar the ideas are to each other and a lot of them came to my mind as well. People are just the same haha. 

The simplicity of Coda gives you definitely the feeling that you can make it too. I am browsing through the projects to steal the best features to my health conditions app haha. I am not gonna finish it today but hopefully soon. I think the Coda is a pretty useful tool for your pre-MVP you just show it to do public and see if someone else is on the same page.

I think I am definitely closer to actually make something I was a few days back. Will see Will see. :)

Stay with me. Efran.
