The writing habit is still here. There are days you can write as crazy, you fulfill your commitment right in the morning and the struggle is gone. The stress-free day ahead of you. Not dark thoughts back in your mind. Gonna be my streak prolonged or forgotten in the history. 4 hours, 2 hours, 1hour and 30 minutes left. Getting sweaty, Do I give up? 

It is so simple just close my laptop, switch off the lights and go to bed. Let the dreams walk into my night. Sure I would fall asleep, sure it wouldn't change much. Only a little thing, void feeling somewhere in the back of my head. Would I come back again or would I give up forever?

You never know. I don't know. A streak is a powerful tool but with the zero upfront would lose all their magic. So fast so easy ... just one day and that's it. 

The Addiction of writing, addiction of showing around, all of that would be gone. 

Who stays who leaves ...  such a thin line between ... 

.... I am happy don't have to think about it today .... cuz we are #teamstreak and we stay ... 136 day and still counting ... 

Take care.

Stay with me. Efran.
