Okay, I was super excited about the "So good they can't ignore you" and I guess it was one of the best books I have read recently, just on point to my current situation. I with no hesitation jumped straight to the last book of Cal Newport "Digital minimalism". I finished it promptly but to be honest I didn't like it.

I totally agree with the topic of the book. We should use digital assets (apps, social networks, etc.) a little bit less and do not get distracted all the time. I would like to practice that as well.

Still, it's anything new under the sun. I guess people simply know it and try to control their "social networks cravings". 

Also, the style of writing feels just weird, It looks like the Cal did a few steps back with his writing style. Like he wouldn't have enough time, didn't do his research properly. All the ideas look blank without depth. I just couldn't identify with that.

I hope he will get better with his next book. 

Kinda harsh review but otherwise I am a nice guy, haha :D

  

I know @basilesamel just read it recently. What is your opinion about the book?
