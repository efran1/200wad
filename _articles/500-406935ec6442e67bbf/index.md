Whohaaa. 500 hundred days in a row. 

Kinda crazy. 

Thank you @brandonwilson you really motivate me to keep going.

The streak has a magic power. I really don't wanna break it. I guess I will still hang around here. I am sorry :D. (I have a long streak in Duolingo, long streak in Makerlog. The streak is probably the best motivation for me. It's not ideal. I should have also another stimulation but it is what it is. :)

I do not write just here as you know. I have my personal blog where I have one post a week schedule. I have Nocodemag which could work very well but I didn't get hooked (I will probably sell it or move to another no-coder). I have a local niche project which started at the end of February, another weekly blog post. These days I will start probably my most ambitious project - Local newsletter - which brings another package of writing.

Yeah, I cannot really jump out of this writing train. 

Sometimes it's exhausting but I can see it leads somewhere. I am on the way in the right direction (Hopefully :))

Let's see where it's gonna go. See you at 600.

Stay safe. Efran :)
