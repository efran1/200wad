I go into a reading madness. I read I, Asimov (autobiography about famous sci-fi writer), I am about to finish Pebble in the sky (Asimov's first novel), I stared Power of Now and I have in the queue another two novels of Asimov.  In the case of reading, I am in a good streak, haha. I combine Czech written books and English written books. I do not mind reading in English, I just do not know how much of the story is made up of my mind if I do not understand properly, haha. 

I try to improve also my Adobe Illustrator skills and making every day some logo designs. It's not any good but practice makes perfect. I finished two courses on Udemy and now I do a specialized course for logo design. I guess it's gonna be everything I do not plan to pay for any more courses. Now I will try to teach form youtube videos and so.

  

My days are pretty similar right now but I do not complain and try to get the most out of the isolation.

Hopefully, it's gonna get better soon.

Let's dive into my books again.

Stay safe. Efran
