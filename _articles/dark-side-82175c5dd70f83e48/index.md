... sometimes we tend to pretend that there are none. Every year just focusing on the new nice habits. Work out more, eat healthier, be positive, be more productive, meditate, building healthy relationships, be a better boyfriend/girlfriend, avoid toxic people, smile more, read more, write more, sleep more, simply live more (no exception for me) ... 

It's easy or better to forget the bad things about your personality. That's why I try to be super honest with myself now and dig a little bit deeper to my dark side ... 

I would say I am super impatient, cannot stand to wait for a second longer if I want something - mostly if I am talking about earning money haha. I want them now, no hard work behind it, just please give me and I am leaving for the trip around the world tomorrow. Goodbye.

My view of the world it's kinda pessimistic I am often in the bad mood and I am showing it off.

I am too comfortable, if I am planning to chill all day at home, I just want to chill if I must change my plans I am grumpy.

I can be pretty competitive. I don't like to lose. (streak streak streak haha)

  

Whooa, better to stop now cuz you wouldn't talk to me anymore haha.

What about you? Which aspects of your personality would you like to improve?

Please stay with me. Efran.
