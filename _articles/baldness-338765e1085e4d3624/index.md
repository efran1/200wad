Okay, today is the day.

Let's talk about this painful thing. I just came from the Barbershop and I shaved all my hair.

It was a super hard decision even though not much happening on top of my head already. I would say I was maybe 6 years late to do it.

Anyway, who does not need to experience this problem, cannot probably really understand how painful it is.

Actually, I already shave once all my hair. It was about 5 years ago, but I wasn't able to keep it. Slowly I let my thin hair to grow back. Still, it was a disaster. The top of my head was holding just a little thing called hair and I actually never feel really comfortable about it. Especially if I went for a date or something.

Anyway, the new phase of my life is here. I hope I am gonna be able to embrace this look and be comfortable about it and hopefully it's gonna change my life in a positive way.

Okay, I just need to get used to it. I do not look that bad, haha. Yeah, new me in 2020.

It's gonna be probably still kinda shock for my coworkers but they will get used to it I am sure.

Enjoy your Saturday :)
