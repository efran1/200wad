One of the strongest memory of my Italy trip (except for my dad being totally crazy with his BASE jumping) it is doing the Ferrata trip.

I knew what does it mean but I have never expected it could be that hard and challenging. A lot of my friends doing trips for these amazing rock climbing routes but it's usually guys and girls together. So I thought it cannot be that hard if even girls can easily make it.

How wrong I could be. There is a grade of every Ferrata. It can be easy but also very hard. My father kinda doesn't care so he just picked the closest one and as I discovered after the trip it was harder one. I already knew cuz I could feel it on the way.

You climbed straight up and it was a neverending route. The weather definitely didn't help. It began to rain on the way so you can imagine the situation.

In one moment I was very desperate (maybe two moments). My strengths were fading and I couldn't see the finish line. 

I tried to do not to look down and just keep going. I could feel the fear and uncertainty but if you once decided to take the route you cannot give up cuz simply there is no way back. All my cries wouldn't help at all so I just needed to handle the situation. 

I am not gonna lie after the last climb I took a deep breath and thanked god. Also, my father is very calm in these situations so it's definitely helped a lot.

What an experience!
