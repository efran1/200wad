New month, new hope. Yeah, welcome May.

I do not set any special goals for May I would like to continue with my Niche project (one post a week), I am gonna post some guest posts on Nocodemag (two companies reached me out after I tweeted about it) and renew my Youtube channel. It definitely takes some effort but it's not undoable.

I continue with my logo and photoshop challenge. So far I enjoy more the photoshop drawings maybe cuz I can see there better progress. With the logos, there is one good against 5 bad ones. I hope it is still helping my skills. I do record videos of the creations. It should be some of the first content for my channel.

Today is the day tenth of my challenge, 20 more days left. My room is getting filled with a lot of drawings. Art is Hard. :D It's gonna worth millions soon. Yeah, don't plan to sell it cheap :D.

  

Otherwise, I want to continue running, twice a week. So far it is just a very short run. I could maybe prolong it a little bit. I am happy I force myself to go. I have been doing it already over a mont.T his habit getting stronger :).

Stay safe. Efran
