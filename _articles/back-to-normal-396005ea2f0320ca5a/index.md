Okay, our government speeds up the process and since Monday we are gonna be more or less in the normal mode.

Shops and restaurants can open, people can hang out outside, and so on. There is still a lot of restrictions, we still have to wear face masks, the events are limited but compare to previous month it's like heaven. 

Sure, the following weeks are gonna be critical. Are we gonna get a hard hit of new COVID cases? Who knows... We can hope for not.  Sure the daily counts will arise but our hospitals are ready so it should be covered. 

I am not afraid. I think it's highly needed now. If it would take longer people would get crazy and lost much more money and maybe there would be more additional problems than COVID itself.

People must start thinking positively and get the virus out of their minds. The ubiquitous fear cannot help anyone. 

Yeah, no more stress. A lot of people hang out outside already today. The weather is good, let's catch some sun.

So let's hope for a brighter future, We are back. I believe. Time to get moving again.

Stay safe. Efran
