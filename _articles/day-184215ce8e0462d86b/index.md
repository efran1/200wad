Busy Saturday. Need to take mom to another city for her meeting. I am gonna drive a car for a long time. Wish me luck hehe.

Anyway, not much time for writing today but sometimes you need to care about family hehe.

Today I ate really healthy foods, McDonald's for lunch and Pizza for dinner. To be honest I don't really care. I don't feel bad about it. During the week I try always eating healthier (or at least pick the healthiest food from the menu :) ). So on the weekend is good to take the total day off hehe. After a long time, I did take a coca cola I liked the taste again but probably not gonna miss it.

What a busy day. Funny to hanging around in a different city. See other people. Listen to their conversation. Sometimes it's a completely different world. It definitely makes me think. The bubble in your circle is real. Step out and see the wonder and reality.

I just cannot write anything good today. I am sorry. Ok, a few words left. 

I am back safely at home so everything good. 

Have a nice rest of your Saturday.

Stay with me. Efran.
