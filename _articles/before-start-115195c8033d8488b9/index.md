Starting a project is not so easy how I expected. I mean I can always find a lot of excuses and never actually start working on it. Listed excuses below always coming to my mind.

*   bad notebook
*   don't have enough time cuz of my full-time job
*   not sure about technology to use
*   cannot really visualize the final product
*   how much should I invest 
*   should I use this, this or this plugin
*   omg the idea is so stupid .. or not .. or yes .. or not
*   should I start with something simpler
*   cannot make it by myself

and so on...and so on...

Not gonna lie it's a hassle. Also, it's making me super insecure to actually checking the listed projects on Product Hunt. People really making nice stuff and don't know if I would have even strength or skills to make something comparable. 

_Are you crying again Efran?_ Sure I do cuz it's much easier, haha. 

I am not giving up. I just will do it my way. Without stress, without a deadline, without big expectation just as my laziness and life paint it haha.

11.11 PM. Time to go to bed and dream about a brighter future. 

Sweet dreams and good night. :)

Stay with me. Efran.
