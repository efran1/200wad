Ok.. running again haha.

Today the shortest in the history I just wasn't in the running mode even though I could run quite easily. The wake up part is still pretty easy.

Waiting for the crisis haha. Really need to run a little longer at least 25 minutes but still it's more that I wanna do it as fast as possible more than I would be thinking about good technique and proper exercise.

Anyway I am still in the beginning of the story. :)

Tomorrow I am not gonna run in the morning cuz I will not be sleeping at my place. Hopefully I will still manage to go later. It will be a motivational battle for sure but I have to .. to complete the whole week. 

It's not ideal to talking about habits as "I have to" or "I must" but I am gonna get to the enjoy part later, haha. 

Btw. I am already 3 weeks without coffee. I think I am getting used to it. But cannot really see some obvious improvements or impairment.

Today I am going to some party that's why I need to do all the habits already now. 

Enjoy your weekend.

Stay with me. Efran.
