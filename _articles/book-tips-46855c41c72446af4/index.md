[Gabriel](https://200wordsaday.com/writers/gabrielgreco) wrote in one of his posts if you wanna be a better writer you shouldn't just write a lot but you should read a lot as well. You can check his post [here](https://200wordsaday.com/words/why-few-people-write-well-41945c3d0dc903133) it is a nice one and of course, he is right!:)

In 2018 I didn't read much. I was a little lazy and also I am always getting stuck during the selecting process of a new book to read and usually I am giving up because I can never find anything good or anything good for my current mood.

That's why I am asking you:).

Do you have any tips for a good book? It can be your favorite or some of the nice books you have read recently.

Here are some of my favorite books.

1.  **The Bad girl** by Mario Vargas Llosa - Its a novel about life long love  
    
2.  **The Naked Came I** by David Weiss - Again a novel but this time about a life of sculpturist August Rodin  
    
3.  **Beartown** by Fredrik Bachman - It's about an ice hockey team in a small city

Recently I have really enjoyed the **Remembrance of Earth's Past series**. It's a sci-fi trilogy by Liu Cixin.

Thank you.

Stay tuned. Efran.
