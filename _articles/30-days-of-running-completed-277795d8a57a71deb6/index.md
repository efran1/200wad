Okay, a few weeks back I started running and I made a commitment to do it 30 days in a row.

What a surprise but actually I could make it. The last 30 days was about running.

I run a total 100 KM. The longest run was 10 KM, the shortest one 2.4 KM.

Except for cardio it has a very positive impact on my morning routine. As I wrote yesterday after the running I added a few more things - a little exercise, cold shower, and nice breakfast.Â 

It just completely changed the start of the day and I am very happy about it.

Cuz of all these changes I do not plan to stop. I will not probably go every day but most of the days I wanna continue.

Maintain this habit is gonna be probably much harder than the challenge itself, haha.

If you would be interested you can see the whole post on my personal blog here:

One challenged completed let's start some new. :) Now I could do something with my night routine hehe. Will see. I didn't start anything yet.

btw. still, do not drink coffee and eat a very limited amount of sugar.

Stay with me. Efran.
