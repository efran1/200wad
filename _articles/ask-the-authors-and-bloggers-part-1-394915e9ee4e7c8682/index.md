Okay, I had kinda this idea in my mind. What about the famous bloggers or authors would they answer me if I ask them something?

I quickly write down some questions and simply send a few emails around. The expectation was low (my questions were stupid and It was really cold email template) but if you do not try, right?!

I tried bloggers from all kinds of fields (marketing, finance, writing, self-help) and I even asked some authors of my favorite books.

..... and I got some answers! :) It really cheers you up. 

You can check the first part of the answers on my today's blog post here: 

[Let’s Ask the Authors and Bloggers – Part 1](https://www.worktravelenjoy.com/lets-ask-the-authors-and-bloggers-part-1/)

Even some big names replied to my email (Mark Manson, Paul Jarvis or Greg McKeown) which was quite surprising. I am gonna show their answers in the following parts.

A really good experience. I didn't want to bother them much but some of them replied with a big effort and valued information. 

If I am gonna be a famous author once I must do the same. Never let my fans down. I promise :D.

If I find some better questions I am gonna keep going with this little project. It's good to see that behind the websites are really nice people.
