Today I uploaded another video to my Youtube channel. Its just another logo design from my 30 days challenge. It a logo from day two but I decided that I am not gonna publish all the daily logo designs. One of the reasons is that most of them are very very bad so I am kinda embarrassed and the second reason is that it would be too boring. 

I am gonna make some showreel and the end of the challenge where I will show all the daily logo designs in some shorter version of making process or maybe just in one picture.

You can see the video from today here: [Logo Design Challenge - Day 2 (Adobe Illustrator - Speedart)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuvFvWoWtr8)

I totally forgot I wanna keep a weekly schedule with the uploading of new videos. Fortunately, I premade all the daily videos so I just need to make some voice over and thumbnail. The process of making is pretty fast. I started using Adobe Premiere for the video making (I have the 2017 version). 

It's all right. I learned the basics from Youtube tutorials. I do not need any special effects and big editing skills. I could make it just in iMovie but I feel better if I use Adobe Premiere, hehe.
