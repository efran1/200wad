Today I was a little bit more active. We have a lot of books so I put a few of them online for sale. My mom recently started to buy very crappy books and I need to get rid of them. It's not a business I just wanna have more space. I just give them a few Czech crowns.

It will be probably the story of my life for the following days.Â 

I am also thinking to start an e-commerce website. I haven't decided yet for sure but it is the easiest way to start making some money. Just let them flow and see a light at the end of the tunnel.

I am in the corner now. No more time left. I am gonna also look for a new job. This part of my life was interesting but I didn't fulfill my goals so I need to get back on track. Be a man and start taking my life seriously will see how it will go with all the situation around. I am not afraid. Life is hard and that okay. I can do all kinds of work. I don't mind.

Enjoy your weekend.
