I would say I am getting pretty famous. My youtube channel has already 9 subscribers. One more and I am gonna beat the all-time youtube record of mine (channel for my gym sacks had exactly 9 subscribers).

It's gonna be definitely time for celebration.

Okay, I am just joking around. Even nobody really cares about my channel I still kinda like to record. Why not try something new right? Even if it's uncomfortable sometimes hehe. Fortunately, I do not care that much about it. 

You can see my last video here: [Coda - IdeasKeeper 1.5 - How to use (what works for me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJVZDCwOQRM)

After a long time, I sent an email campaign at my full-time job. So far open rate 23% it's not that bad. It was just about 200 contacts nothing big. Still, I always feel a little bit stressed that I screwed something. Anyway, I guess everything went well.

Still thinking about yesterdays project .. now I am not so sure if I should make it. Will keep it in my mind for a while and decide later.

Ok, that's it for today, some random thoughts again. The boxing lesson awaiting and I need be beaten up a little bit hehe.

Take care.

Stay with me. Efran.
