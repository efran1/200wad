April was fast. Welcome, May.

Nothing mentionable happened in April. I had finished a lot of books. I very like "_So good they can't ignore you_" by Cal Newport.

I am just happy about my "asking" project. It was a nice experience. 

Anyway, I wrote down a regular monthly review. You can see it here:

The next month I would like to keep working on my Niche project, I would like to renew and rename my Youtube channel and put there more design-related content, fun, and some challenges. It's just a very tempting experience and I would like to try it.  Let's make some embarrassing videos, hehe.

I am happy I could keep myself busy and don't fall into lethargy and unproductive days.

Of course, I usually take it easy but I am still able to follow my schedule and do what is needed. It's important in this lockdown times.

I do not check the news. So I feel pretty all right. I am not really affected my this coronavirus madness and I truly believe it's gonna be over soon. We will see how economic catch-up.

Stay safe. Efran
