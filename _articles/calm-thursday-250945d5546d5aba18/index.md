Pretty slow day at work. As I already mentioned the last few days are lazy on my side. I cannot even find the right topic to write about. This post is written by the most dangerous writing app cuz I would like to just finish my writing routine soon.

I have still stronger feeling to take some vacation. It's not really cuz I would feel too tired but maybe more cuz I would like to think more about all my stuff. Do not care about the daily job back in my mind. Just pure focus on myself.

I am thinking to visit my friend in the mountains. Go for a nice walk in nature and free up my mind. I wouldn't just wander outside but also stay someday at home and focus on my writing.

It sounds really nice to me. Hopefully, I am gonna do it. I think I could take the next week off but not sure yet.

I would like to definitely switch off the phone and really just do not care for a while  even though I do not use my phone that much. For example, my boss calling all day long. I would get crazy if I would have to do it.

Stay with me. Efran.
