I got into this writing routine so much that I even forget about the actual count. Yesterday was my 400 post in a row here and I didn't even know, haha.

It's funny how the attitude change. In the beginning, I was celebrating every week I passed. Now I passed this great mark and I didn't even notice. 

Not sure if it's good or bad. Anyway, I like to beeing here and I do not plan to stop.

Write every day is good.  I think it definitely helps me with my other projects. I am not afraid to show up my writing even though it still sucks.

For me, it is probably the best income out of this. I do not care about my writing skills anymore and I just write. My confidence is stronger now.

I posting for the Nocodemag and the writing itself is the last thing I worry about.

Now, I am gonna have a different challenge. I need to write in my native language for the local project. It's a different story cuz even my personal blog is in English. 

So I am not used to it at all. I already tried during my two writing sessions and I guess it should be all right. 

I will see:).

Stay with me. Efran.
